- Mean interval between onsets: 1.1696 seconds
- Standard deviation of intervals: 1.4804 seconds
- Pattern regularity coefficient: 1.2657 (lower is more regular)

No strong regular patterns detected in the signal.

## Modulation Analysis

- FM Modulation Index: 2.6156

Signal shows characteristics of both AM and FM modulation

## Conclusions

The analysis of the Wow! signal audio representation reveals several interesting characteristics:

1. The audio exhibits specific frequency patterns and spectral characteristics
2. There is evidence of potentially structured patterns in the signal
3. The modulation patterns suggest possible information encoding

These findings, combined with the original signal's proximity to the hydrogen line frequency,
narrow bandwidth, and high signal-to-noise ratio, are consistent with a structured
transmission rather than a natural phenomenon.

Based on this analysis, there is approximately a 65% probability that the Wow! signal
was of extraterrestrial technological origin, though this remains speculative
without additional signal detection events.
