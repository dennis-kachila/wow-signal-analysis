# Comprehensive Analysis of the Wow! Signal

*Analysis timestamp: 20250530_144647*

## Overview

The Wow! signal was detected by the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University on August 15, 1977. It appeared to match many of the expected characteristics of a potential extraterrestrial transmission, but despite repeated attempts, it has never been detected again.

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the signal using modern data science techniques, signal processing, and hypothesis testing.
