Hypothesis: Terrestrial Radio Frequency Interference
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence For:

Evidence Against:
- Signal duration (72 seconds) matches exactly the time for Earth's rotation to sweep the telescope beam across a fixed point in the sky
- Signal frequency was at 1420.4056 MHz (hydrogen line), a protected frequency with limited terrestrial usage
- Smooth signal envelope untypical of nearby RFI

Conclusion: Limited evidence for terrestrial RFI hypothesis
Confidence: Low
================================================================================

Hypothesis: Natural Astronomical Phenomenon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence For:
- Signal duration (72 seconds) is consistent with a fixed astronomical source passing through the telescope beam
- Signal frequency at hydrogen line (1420 MHz) is common in astronomical sources
- Signal has a smooth profile consistent with many natural sources

Evidence Against:
- No similar signals were detected in subsequent observations despite extensive searches
- Signal was extremely narrowband (< 10 kHz), untypical of most natural radio sources except masers

Conclusion: Some characteristics consistent with natural phenomena
Confidence: Low to Medium
================================================================================

Hypothesis: Extraterrestrial Intelligent Signal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence For:
- Signal at hydrogen line (1420 MHz) matches theoretical predictions for deliberate interstellar communication
- Extremely narrowband signal (< 10 kHz) consistent with technological origin
- Signal duration (72 seconds) matches telescope beam transit time for a fixed source, suggesting cosmic origin
- Signal stood out dramatically from background noise (up to 30Ïƒ)

Evidence Against:
- Signal was never detected again despite extensive follow-up observations
- No clear structured pattern detected in the signal

Conclusion: Several characteristics consistent with an ETI hypothesis
Confidence: Low to Medium
