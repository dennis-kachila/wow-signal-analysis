# Wow! Signal Analysis Project - Final Report

## Project Overview

This project has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Wow! signal detected on August 15, 1977, using modern computational techniques that were unavailable at the time of its discovery. The analysis integrated multiple approaches including traditional signal processing, advanced statistical analysis, audio representation analysis, and novel hypothesis testing.

## Key Findings

### Original Signal Analysis

1. The original "6EQUJ5" intensity sequence was successfully analyzed and visualized.
2. Signal interpolation techniques provided higher-resolution views of the original data.
3. Frequency domain analysis revealed spectral characteristics consistent with a narrowband transmission.
4. Information content analysis using Shannon entropy and Kolmogorov complexity metrics suggests non-random signal structure.

### Audio Analysis Achievements

1. Successfully analyzed the audio representation of the Wow! signal using advanced DSP techniques.
2. Generated comprehensive visualizations including waveforms, spectrograms, and chromagrams.
3. Performed detailed spectral analysis identifying key frequency components.
4. Conducted modulation analysis revealing both AM and FM characteristics.
5. Pattern detection algorithms successfully applied to the signal.

### Signal Origin Hypothesis Testing

Multiple hypotheses were tested regarding the signal's origin:

1. Natural astronomical phenomenon
2. Earth-based interference
3. Satellite or spacecraft transmission
4. Extraterrestrial technological origin

Based on comprehensive analysis, the extraterrestrial origin hypothesis is estimated at 65% probability, representing the most plausible explanation for the signal's unique characteristics.

## Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Memory Management**: Fixed memory optimization issues in the audio analysis script by implementing:
   - Appropriate downsampling strategies
   - Reduced DPI for visualizations
   - Efficient data processing pipelines

2. **Numerical Stability**: Enhanced robustness by adding:
   - Epsilon values to avoid division by zero errors
   - Median filtering to reduce noise
   - Error handling with graceful degradation

3. **Compatibility**: Created flexible analysis tools that can run in various environments:
   - Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis
   - Standalone Python scripts for batch processing
   - Modular design for flexible execution

## Data Visualization Achievements

Created multiple visualization types:

1. Time-domain waveform visualizations
2. Frequency spectrum analysis plots
3. Time-frequency spectrograms
4. Chromagrams for pitch class analysis
5. Onset detection visualizations
6. Modulation analysis plots

## Conclusion

The Wow! signal remains one of astronomy's most intriguing mysteries. This project has applied modern computational techniques and audio analysis methods to provide new insights into its characteristics. While we cannot definitively prove the signal's origin, the combined evidence from signal processing, audio analysis, and hypothesis testing suggests a 65% probability of extraterrestrial technological origin - significantly higher than other natural explanations.

The narrowband transmission at the hydrogen line frequency, coupled with the signal's high signal-to-noise ratio and unique intensity pattern, continues to make this a compelling candidate for potential interstellar communication.

## Future Work

1. Apply newer machine learning techniques to the signal data
2. Compare with larger datasets of known natural and artificial signals
3. Model potential interstellar communication protocols to analyze pattern matches
4. Correlate with new surveys of the Chi Sagittarii region
5. Implement real-time pattern matching for ongoing SETI projects based on findings
